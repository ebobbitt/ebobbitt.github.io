<p> My dream to speak around the world was nurtured in church, school and at community events. Opportunities presented to me to speak around the world, included locations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Africa. I have come to realize that speaking is not an easy task for some as it has been for me, for I get excited for opportunities to engage with others!  Soft skills development prepares the way, and it is my mission to share all that I have learned to help industry professionals SOAR (Speak Optimistically and Always Respectfully)!</p>
